# Game-Learning-super-mario-bros2-v1-
Reinforcement learning using different models on OpenAI Gym Super Mario Bros environment to learn and complete the game. The environment provides the reward-able game frames for training. Metrics such as reward and game score are used to compare the different models used.

## Reinforcement learning algorithms
- Double Deep Q-learning (DDQN)
- Resnet50
- MobileNet

## Results
DDQN shows the best results. The following shows an overall increase in reward and game score during the first 50 episodes.
